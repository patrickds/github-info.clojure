# Github Info

A very nice program where you input your github username and it shows you `less` information than github already shows you ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

But it was tdded from the ground up in clojure!

## Usage

You will need:

- [Java](https://java.com/en/download/)
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

### Then

```shell
lein deps               # install all dependencies
lein test               # runs all tests
lein test:watch         # runs all tests in watch mode
lein run:cli            # runs the cli app
lein run:server         # runs the server app
lein run:server:watch   # runs the server app and and reloads on file changes
lein format             # formats all source files
lein lint               # lint all source files
```
